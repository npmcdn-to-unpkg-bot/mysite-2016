WalnutJS is a Image Viewer made with JavaScript. It's an overlay viewer that fills the screen with the slider. It's responsive and this viewer is good for someone how needs something fast and don't want to put down a lot of time trying to figure out how it works.

My friend ask me if I knew any good image viewer and I couldn't come up with any specific. I know there are a lot of different once out there, but I wanted one of my own.
